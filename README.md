## Overview

This project consists of the following components:

- `code/agent.py`: A single AI agent that attempts to solve IMO problems with default base model: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- `code/agent_oai.py`: A single AI agent that uses OpenAI GPT-5 model (same CLI/usage as `agent.py`)
- `code/agent_xai.py`: A single AI agent that uses XAI Grok-4-0709 models (same CLI/usage as `agent.py`)
- `code/run_parallel.py`: A parallel execution system that runs multiple agents simultaneously
- `code/res2md.py`: A small utility to parse a result file that contains JSON (e.g., JSONL) and print the last JSON object

These agents have successfully solved IMO 2025 problems 1–5 in internal runs (logs attached), indicative of gold-medal performance.

## Run logs

- `run_logs/`: initial runs using Google Gemini 2.5 Pro as the base model
- `run_logs_gpt5/`: runs using OpenAI GPT-5 as the base model
- `run_logs_grok4/`: runs using XAI Grok-4 as the base model

These folders contain example successful run logs demonstrating end-to-end solutions produced by the respective base models.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. **API key(s) for your chosen provider(s)**:
   - Google Gemini: <https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>
   - OpenAI: <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>
   - XAI: Refer to your XAI account portal for API key issuance
3. **Required Python packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Set up your API key(s)**:
   - Set environment variables in your shell for the providers you plan to use, for example:
     - `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key`
     - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key`
     - `export XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key`

## Usage

### Single Agent (`agent.py`, `agent_oai.py`, `agent_xai.py`)

Run a single agent to solve an IMO problem (usage and flags are the same for all three agents):

```bash
python agent.py problem.txt [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `problem.txt`: Path to the problem statement file (required); imo2025 problems are in `problems`

**Options:**

- `--log LOG_FILE`: Specify a log file for output (default: prints to console)
- `--other_prompts PROMPTS`: Additional prompts separated by commas

**Example:**

```bash
python agent.py imo2025_p1.txt --log agent_output.log
```

python code/agent.py problems/imo01.txt --log agent_output.log

uv run code/agent.py problems/imo01.txt --log agent_output.log

To run with OpenAI or XAI instead, simply invoke the corresponding script with the same options:

```bash
python agent_oai.py imo2025_p1.txt --log agent_output_oai.log
python agent_xai.py imo2025_p1.txt --log agent_output_xai.log
```

### Parallel Execution (`code/run_parallel.py`)

Run multiple agents in parallel to increase the chance of finding a solution:

```bash
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py <problem_file> [options]
```

**Arguments:**

- `problem.txt`: Path to the problem statement file (required). Use an absolute path or ensure the path is valid from within `IMO25/code/` (the script runs the agent with its working directory set to `IMO25/code/`).

**Options:**

- `--num-agents N` or `-n N`: Number of parallel agents (default: 10)
- `--log-dir DIR` or `-d DIR`: Directory for log files (default: logs)
- `--timeout SECONDS` or `-t SECONDS`: Timeout per agent in seconds (default: no timeout)
- `--max-workers N` or `-w N`: Maximum worker processes (default: number of agents)
- `--other_prompts PROMPTS` or `-o PROMPTS`: Additional prompts separated by commas
- `--agent-file PATH` or `-a PATH`: Path to the agent file to run (default: `agent.py` inside `IMO25/code/`)
- `--exit-immediately` or `-e`: Exit the whole run as soon as any agent finds a correct solution (otherwise, all agents run to completion)

**Examples:**

```bash
# Run 20 agents with 5-minute timeout each
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py problems/imo2025_p1.txt -n 20 -t 300

# Run 5 agents with custom log directory and exit immediately on first success
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py problems/imo2025_p1.txt -n 5 -d logs/p1_run -e

# Run with additional prompts and a custom agent file
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py problems/imo2025_p1.txt -n 15 -o "focus_on_geometry,use_induction" -a agent.py

# Run OpenAI/XAI variants by pointing to the agent file
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py problems/imo2025_p1.txt -n 10 -a agent_oai.py
python IMO25/code/run_parallel.py problems/imo2025_p1.txt -n 10 -a agent_xai.py
```

### Result extractor (`code/res2md.py`)

Parse a result file that contains JSON (for example, a `.jsonl` file where each line is a JSON object), and print the last JSON object in the file. Useful for quickly extracting the final structured result produced by some runs.

```bash
python IMO25/code/res2md.py <result_file>
```

**Example:**

```bash
python IMO25/code/res2md.py logs/results.jsonl
```

## Problem File Format

See the `problems` folder.

## Output and Logging

### Single Agent

- Output is printed to console by default
- Use `--log` to save output to a file
- The agent will indicate if a complete solution was found

### Parallel Execution

- Each agent creates a separate log file in the specified directory
- Progress is shown in real-time
- Final summary shows:
  - Total execution time
  - Number of successful/failed agents
  - Success rate
  - Which agent found a solution (if any)
  - Location of log files
- Each log entry includes a timestamp

## Understanding the Output

### Solution Detection

The system looks for the phrase "Found a correct solution in run" to identify successful solutions.

### Agent Behavior

- Agents can use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI, or XAI models depending on the chosen script
- Each agent follows a structured approach with multiple attempts
- Solutions are verified for completeness and correctness
- Agents can provide partial solutions if complete solutions aren't found

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Problem Formatting**: Ensure your problem file is clear and well-formatted
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use more agents for harder problems (10-20 agents recommended)
3. **Timeout Settings**: Set reasonable timeouts (you may set no timeout)
4. **API Limits**: Be aware of Google/OpenAI/XAI API rate limits and costs
5. **Log Analysis**: Check individual agent logs for detailed reasoning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure the relevant API key(s) are properly set (Google/OpenAI/XAI)
2. **Timeout Issues**: Increase timeout or reduce number of agents
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce max-workers if running out of memory
4. **No Solutions Found**: Try running more agents or check problem clarity

### Debug Mode

Add verbose logging by modifying the agent code or check individual log files for detailed output.

## Changelog

### 08/18/2025

- Added `code/agent_oai.py` and `code/agent_xai.py` (usage identical to `agent.py`).
- Logs now record timestamps.
- Parallel runs no longer exit by default when a solution is found; use `--exit-immediately` to stop at the first complete solution.
- Adding running logs from grok-4 and gpt-5
